# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Sales Analysis in SQL

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL-based data analysis on an e-commerce dataset.  
The goal was to explore customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance by writing queries at **three difficulty levels**:  
- âœ… Basic  
- ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate  
- ðŸ”´ Advanced  

The queries were executed in **MySQL**, and the results were visualized in a presentation slide deck for better storytelling.
